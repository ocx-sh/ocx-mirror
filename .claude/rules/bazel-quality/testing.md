summary: The BZL-TEST family — the contract every test target signs, the tag taxonomy, sizing and sharding, Starlark and repository-rule tests, and coverage runs that report green while measuring nothing

# Testing

Owns `BZL-TEST`: what a `*_test` target signs up to, the sandbox/cache/network tags
and `manual`, `size`/`timeout`/`shard_count`/`flaky`, testing Starlark rules,
repository rules and module extensions offline, and every way `bazel coverage` exits
0 while measuring nothing. It does not own which tests CI selects or how a matrix is
built — that is `BZL-CI`. The build-level flags that make a tag load-bearing are
`BZL-HERM`; the cache flags and eviction semantics are `BZL-CACHE`; module resolution
and lockfiles are `BZL-MOD`; the `load()` statements that Bazel 9.0.0's autoload
removal now requires for `sh_test`, `py_test` and `cc_test` are `BZL-LARK`. Four
sibling rows are cited, never restated: `BZL-HERM-02` (setting
`--sandbox_default_allow_network=false` for the build, the flag half of what
BZL-TEST-09 tags), `BZL-HERM-21` (never tagging a `diff_test` or `write_source_files`
target `manual` — the one thing BZL-TEST-11's carve-out must not be read to permit),
`BZL-LARK-24` (the `expect_failure` unspellable-constant rule and the seen-red drill)
and `BZL-LARK-25` (the integration test that builds a real target out of a
string-generated repository).

Severity maps onto the house tiers: MUST = Block, SHOULD = Warn, CONSIDER = Suggest.
Version-bound claims were measured 2026-09-06 against real Bazel 8.7.0, 8.8.0 and
9.2.0 binaries on Linux, and bind bazel-skylib 1.9.0, rules_python 2.3.3, rules_js
3.4.1, rules_rust 0.74.0 and rules_bazel_integration_test v0.37.1. Before citing any
flag, read it on **both** help surfaces at your own pin — `bazel help <command>
--long` **and** `bazel help startup_options` — because a startup option is invisible
to the command surface, and one Bazel 9 test flag is a Starlark `bool_flag` present on
neither. **Every grep below is blind to BUILD and `.bzl` text generated as a string
inside a `repository_rule` or `module_extension`**: buildifier, stardoc and grep all
stop at the string literal, so an EMPTY grep says nothing about generated repository
content in either direction — `BZL-LARK-25`'s integration test is what sees inside it.

## The Test Target's Own Contract

Two prohibitions from the normative
[test-encyclopedia](https://bazel.build/versions/8.7.0/reference/test-encyclopedia)
that a suite ported from an ordinary runner violates on its first day. The check for
this block, over the test sources the target lists in `srcs`:
`grep -rn -e '/tmp/' -e 'HOME' -e 'dirname.*argv' -e '__file__' -e 'st_atime' <test-sources>`
and, separately, any write targeting a path under `$TEST_SRCDIR` or a `*.runfiles`
directory. EMPTY = PASS.

| ID | Rule | Rationale | Verification | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BZL-TEST-12 | Write test output, temp files and intermediate state only under `$TEST_TMPDIR` or `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`, and resolve every input through runfiles — never `/tmp`, never a home directory, never a path derived from the test executable's own location. | Those two variables name the only paths the test-encyclopedia guarantees private and writable; everything else is unspecified, may not exist, and may be shared with a concurrently running test. `HOME` is unset in the action environment on 8.7.0 and 9.2.0 alike (measured), so a path built from it does not merely collide — it resolves to nothing. A harness that computes its subject from `__file__` or `argv[0]` is the single most common import from a non-Bazel runner, and under Bazel it finds the sandbox layout instead of the binary. | The block grep above; then read each hit and confirm it routes through `$TEST_TMPDIR`/`$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` or through the runfiles library. EMPTY = PASS. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-13 | Never mutate the runfiles tree during a test run, and never let an assertion or a cache key depend on filesystem atimes. | Both are explicit prohibitions in the normative spec — the runfiles tree "must not change during test execution", and tests "must not assume that atimes are enabled for any mounted filesystem". A test that writes beside its data dep passes locally and corrupts the next test sharing that tree; an atime assertion passes on one mount option and fails on another with no code change. | The block grep for `st_atime`, plus a grep for `chmod`/`chgrp`/`touch`/open-for-write against a path under `$TEST_SRCDIR` or `*.runfiles`. EMPTY = PASS. | MUST |

```python
# wrong — an unspecified path; may be read-only, may be shared
tmp = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "tmp")
# right — the only guaranteed-private writable directory
tmp = os.environ["TEST_TMPDIR"]
```

## Tags, Sandbox and Network

One grep catches this whole block:
`grep -rn -e '"no-remote-cache"' -e '"no-remote-cache-upload"' -e '"external"' -e '"requires-network"' -e '"no-sandbox"' -e '"local"' -e '"manual"' --include='BUILD.bazel' --include='BUILD' --include='*.bzl' .`
EMPTY = PASS (no tag present, nothing to misread); every hit is read against the
definitions below. The cache, sandbox and network semantics here were measured on
8.7.0 and 9.2.0 under `linux-sandbox` on one Linux host and were not reproduced on a
CI runner; `processwrapper-sandbox` (darwin) cannot enforce network denial at all, and
Windows has no sandbox in practice, so every network row degrades to a no-op there.

| ID | Rule | Rationale | Verification | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BZL-TEST-08 | Never treat `no-remote-cache`/`no-remote-cache-upload`, `external`/`requires-network`, or `no-sandbox`/`local` as interchangeable pairs. | All three pairs are measured. `no-remote-cache` kills read *and* write; `no-remote-cache-upload` kills only the `PUT /ac/<digest>` result mapping while that same action's `PUT /cas/` content blobs still upload — so the wrong one either forfeits every cache hit or keeps advertising results that should never have been written. `external` is test-only: on a build action it has no observable effect at all, and under `bazel test --cache_test_results=yes` it makes the tagged test re-execute every invocation while its untagged sibling reports `(cached)`. `no-sandbox` and `local` both force the `local` runner, but `no-sandbox` leaves the action `cacheable:true` and it hits the disk cache on rebuild, while `local` sets `cacheable:false` and re-executes every build. | The block grep, then read each hit's intent against those six definitions. EMPTY = PASS. To *prove* a remote-cache-shaped tag rather than read it, use the instrument that can see it: a real remote-cache endpoint's request log for `no-remote-cache-upload`, and `bazel test --cache_test_results=yes` run twice with no source change for `external` (the tagged test must not report `(cached)`). A `--disk_cache`-only run, and the `--execution_log_json_file` `cacheable`/`remotable` fields, are structurally blind to both — an EMPTY difference there reads "wrong instrument", never "the tag did nothing". | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-09 | Tag a test `requires-network` when the test *action itself* reaches the network; do not tag one whose only network use happened in a repository rule's fetch. | `--sandbox_default_allow_network` defaults `true` on both majors, so an untagged network-touching test passes by flag default rather than declared intent and breaks the instant a stricter sandbox or a remote executor arrives. Measured on 8.7.0 and 9.2.0: with the flag false, `linux-sandbox` genuinely blocks, `requires-network` restores access while staying sandboxed, and `no-sandbox` routes the action to `local`, where there is no namespace to revoke and the network returns. The tag never governs the separate, unsandboxed fetch phase — no sandbox flag reaches a repository rule. `BZL-HERM-02` owns the build-level flag that makes this tag matter. | For every test whose sources or harness makes a live call at execution time (`curl`, a registry hostname, a socket connect), confirm the tag; for a test merely consuming an already-fetched external repository's runfiles, confirm no tag was added. A missing tag on a network-executing test is the finding; an absent tag on a fetch-only consumer = PASS. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-10 | Read `manual` as excluding a target from wildcard expansion for `build`, `test` and `coverage` only — never as hiding the target from `bazel query`, from a dependency graph, or from a CI inventory script that walks `query //...`. | The Build Encyclopedia and the test-encyclopedia state it independently ("bazel query does not respect the manual tag"). The canonical "why did CI never run this" incident is a target a health dashboard reports on and the test command never selects. | `diff <(bazel query 'tests(//...)' \| sort) <(bazel query 'tests(//...) except attr(tags, "manual", //...)' \| sort)` — every line only on the left is `manual` and invisible to what `bazel test //...` runs. EMPTY = PASS. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-11 | Tag every fixture rule instantiated under an `expect_failure` test `manual`, and read an existing `manual` target consumed as a `target_under_test` as correct rather than as a hidden test. | Without the tag, `bazel build //...` builds the intentionally-failing fixture and reports a build failure unrelated to the suite; with it, the target stays visible to `query` and is a fixture rather than an opted-out test — the distinction BZL-TEST-10's diff needs to stay actionable. This carve-out covers failure-test fixtures and the harness fixtures of BZL-TEST-29 only; `BZL-HERM-21` forbids `manual` on a `diff_test` or `write_source_files` target. | For each label passed as `target_under_test =` to an `analysistest.make(expect_failure = True)` rule, confirm its instantiation carries `tags = ["manual"]`. EMPTY (no untagged instantiation) = PASS. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-21 | Prove a "no network" label on a target or task from a cold repository cache before believing it. | The BUILD graph is ground truth and a taskfile or CI-step description drifts from it silently: the recurring shape is a task described as network-free whose `//...` expansion contains two `sh_test`s consuming externally fetched repositories. Code is authoritative; the description is the stale side. | Run the claimed-offline target with `--repository_cache=` pointed at an empty directory and the network denied. Any fetch attempt is the finding; EMPTY (it passes) = PASS. | MUST wherever a target or task is labelled network-free |
| BZL-TEST-07 | Set `execution_requirements` on each `ctx.actions.*` call that needs a sandbox, cache or remote exception — never rely on the target's `tags` reaching the action, and never expect one `tags` list to express different needs for different actions of the same rule. | On a test or `genrule` the tags apply unconditionally. On a Starlark action they arrive only through `--incompatible_allow_tags_propagation` (default `true` on 8.7.0 and 9.2.0), only for a fixed prefix allowlist (`no-`, `requires-`, `block-`, `supports-`, `disable-`, `cpu:`, `resources:`, `local`, worker key), only `putIfAbsent` — so an explicit key in the rule always wins — and the propagated map is target-wide, shared by every action the rule registers. | `grep -rn 'incompatible_allow_tags_propagation' .bazelrc*` (EMPTY = the flag is at its default `true`) **and** grep the rule's `.bzl` for a hardcoded `execution_requirements = {` that shadows the intended tag. EMPTY on both = PASS. | SHOULD |

## Size, Timeout, Sharding and Flakes

Two commands catch this block: `bazel query 'attr(size, "medium", tests(//...))'`
lists every test whose *effective* size is medium, defaulted or explicit (EMPTY = no
medium-sized test to review, which is not proof of correctness), and
`bazel test --test_verbose_timeout_warnings //...` reports a size/timeout mismatch on
stderr (EMPTY = PASS). The RAM and CPU numbers are read from
[be/common-definitions](https://bazel.build/versions/8.7.0/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes-tests)
every time, never from memory.

| ID | Rule | Rationale | Verification | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BZL-TEST-06 | Detect a suspected flake with `--runs_per_test=N --runs_per_test_detects_flakes`; never name `--flaky_test_attempts` or `flaky = True` as a detection tool. **pinned** | Both retry mechanisms stop at the first success and skip the remaining attempts, so a 50%-flaky test "passes" `--flaky_test_attempts=10` close to 100% of the time — they mask, they do not measure, and a Bazel maintainer says so in the closing discussion of [bazel#3783](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3783). `--flaky_test_attempts=default` grants three attempts to targets already carrying `flaky = True` and one to everything else. | Reading heuristic: any runbook, CI step or answer naming `--flaky_test_attempts` as the way to *find* a flake, unpaired with `--runs_per_test_detects_flakes`, is the finding. EMPTY = PASS. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-04 | Add `shard_count` only after confirming the runner touches `TEST_SHARD_STATUS_FILE`, and describe a shard-unaware runner's failure as a hard `LOCAL_TEST_PREREQ_UNMET` — never as "silently runs every test in every shard". | Bazel force-fails a shard that would otherwise have *passed* but left the status file untouched. The `be/common-definitions` prose claiming a silent whole-suite rerun is stale against [`StandaloneTestStrategy.java`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/9.2.0/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/exec/StandaloneTestStrategy.java) on both majors, and because the override fires only on a would-be pass it hides behind unrelated shard failures. | `bazel test --test_sharding_strategy=forced=2 //path:target 2>&1 \| grep -i "did not advertise support for it by touching"`. A match is the finding. EMPTY = PASS (the runner supports sharding, or the target is unsharded). | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-02 | Re-check declared `size`/`timeout` against measured runtime whenever a test's cost changes materially, and re-check it under `bazel coverage` before adding a coverage leg — for every language, not only the ones whose rulesets document it. | A too-tight budget flakes CI and a too-loose one reserves executor slots that go unused. The coverage half is a Bazel-core property, not a ruleset detail: `TestActionBuilder` substitutes `@bazel_tools//tools/test:collect_coverage` for the test binary, and with `--experimental_split_coverage_postprocessing` at its real default (`false` on 8.7.0, 8.8.0 and 9.2.0) the test and the `$LCOV_MERGER` run in one spawn under one `TIMEOUT`; in split mode the second spawn still lives in the same `TestRunnerAction` and times out on its own. Post-processing scales with instrumented-file count, so a test that passes `bazel test` times out under `bazel coverage` with no code change. The *combined* report is a separate, unbudgeted action — do not size for it. | The verbose-timeout run above, then `bazel coverage //target` once, confirming it lands well inside the declared timeout. EMPTY (no warning) = PASS. | SHOULD |
| BZL-TEST-01 | Declare `size` explicitly on any test whose real cost is not `medium`, and treat a defaulted `medium` on a millisecond analysis-phase test as accepted rather than as a defect. **pinned** | `size` sets RAM (20/100/300/800 MB), always exactly 1 CPU, and the default timeout. A silent `medium` on a genuinely heavy test over-schedules the local machine; mandating an explicit `size` on dozens of fake-ctx unit tests that finish in milliseconds is busywork with no payoff, and the merge-blocking value sits one layer down in BZL-TEST-02. | The `bazel query` above; review each listed target against its real cost. EMPTY = PASS. | SHOULD |
| BZL-TEST-05 | Never set `flaky = True`, or a target-scoped `--flaky_test_attempts`, without an adjoining comment naming the root cause and linking a tracking issue. **pinned** | The attribute passes on the first of up to three successes and turns a genuine intermittent bug into silence; the Build Encyclopedia itself calls it discouraged. A bare `flaky = True` with no comment is the finding — the attribute's mere presence is not. | `grep -rn 'flaky[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*True' --include='BUILD.bazel' --include='BUILD' --include='*.bzl' .`, then read each hit for a linked cause. EMPTY = PASS (no `flaky` target exists). | SHOULD |
| BZL-TEST-03 | Add the `cpu:n` tag — never a larger `size` — when a test needs more than one core. | Every size class reserves exactly 1 CPU; the RAM number scales and the CPU number does not. Bumping `size` for parallelism buys no cores and silently changes the RAM reservation and the default timeout instead. | Reading heuristic: grep the test harness or binary for an internal thread pool or a `-j`-style flag; each hit must carry a matching `cpu:n` tag. EMPTY (no internally parallel test) = PASS. | CONSIDER |

```bash
bazel test --flaky_test_attempts=10 //pkg:t                            # stops at first success: green on a 50% flake
bazel test --runs_per_test=10 --runs_per_test_detects_flakes //pkg:t   # runs all ten, reports FLAKY
```

## Testing Starlark, Repository Rules and Extensions

The check for this block: enumerate the subjects with
`grep -rn -e 'repository_rule(' -e 'module_extension(' -e '^def _.*_impl' --include='*.bzl' .`,
then read the `*_test.bzl` files for a matching call site. A subject with no test-file
call site is the finding; an EMPTY enumeration is N/A. Phase gates decide which
harness is legal, and the error text differs by major — 8.7.0 says `repository rules
can only be used while evaluating a WORKSPACE file`, 9.2.0 says `repo rules can only
be called from within module extension impl functions`, so a log grep matches
`Error in repository_rule:` alone.

| ID | Rule | Rationale | Verification | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BZL-TEST-14 | Reach for `unittest.make()` for a pure Starlark function and `analysistest.make()` only when a real `rule()`-produced `Target` exists to depend on. | `analysistest.make()` always injects a mandatory `target_under_test` label with an aspect attached; a `repository_rule` or `module_extension` runs in the loading/fetch phase and produces a repository, not an analysable `Target`. Pointing an analysistest at one is a category error, not a coverage gap. A throwaway harness `rule()` that *calls* an `_impl` is itself a `rule()`-produced target and satisfies this row. | For every `analysistest.make(` call, confirm the paired `target_under_test =` label resolves to a `rule()`-produced target. EMPTY (no analysistest call) is PASS only where the file has no rule-analysis behaviour to test; otherwise it is a gap. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-15 | Give every `repository_rule` `_impl` a `unittest.make()` orchestration test driven by a hand-rolled `repository_ctx` fake, asserting on the fake's recorded side effects as an **ordered** list: which paths were watched and in what order, which URL and `sha256` were downloaded, which files were written. **pinned** | This is the only offline technique that reaches the fetch phase; without it the correctness of the `ctx.download` → `ctx.execute` → `ctx.symlink` → `ctx.file` sequencing rests entirely on slow networked live-registry tests that run far less often than `bazel test //...`. Asserting membership rather than order lets a reordering bug pass. It covers the happy path only — a `unittest.make()` test cannot survive an uncaught `fail()` (BZL-TEST-29) — and it does not replace `BZL-LARK-25`'s integration test, which is the only thing that catches a malformed generated-BUILD string. | The block enumeration: an `_impl` from `repository_rule(` with no non-`load()` call site inside a `*_test.bzl` is the finding. EMPTY (no repository rule) = N/A. | MUST where the `_impl` makes no nested repository-rule call of its own |
| BZL-TEST-29 | Cover every `fail()`-reachable branch of a `repository_rule` or `module_extension` helper with a throwaway `rule()` harness driven by `analysistest.make(expect_failure = True)`, never with a bare `unittest.make()` assertion. | Measured on 8.7.0 and 9.2.0: a harness rule whose `_impl` calls the real `_impl` with a fake ctx, paired with `asserts.expect_failure`, goes red for the failing fixture and green for the succeeding one. The negative control is why this row exists — the identical `fail()` driven through a bare `unittest.make()` test produces no test result at all: analysis aborts and `bazel test` reports "No test targets were found, yet testing was requested" for the whole invocation, so an author reading that run believes in coverage that does not exist. The fragment passed to `asserts.expect_failure` still obeys `BZL-LARK-24`, and the harness fixture still obeys BZL-TEST-11. | For each `fail(` inside a repository-rule or extension `_impl` or its helpers, confirm a matching `analysistest.make(expect_failure = True)` test against a harness fixture. A `fail()` branch reachable only through a `unittest.make()` test is the finding; EMPTY (no `fail()` branch) = N/A. | MUST where a `fail()`-reachable branch exists |
| BZL-TEST-16 | Never claim a ctx fake covers a `module_extension`'s repository-rule-invocation half; cover that half with a real evaluation (`bazel mod deps`) plus a nested-workspace integration test — standing the integration test up is SHOULD, a priced CI cost, but the claim is the MUST. | Measured on both majors: invoking a repository-rule symbol outside real extension evaluation fails identically from loading-phase BUILD top level and from inside an analysis-phase `rule()` harness. It is a Skyframe-phase gate, not a ctx-shape check, and the fake `module_ctx` is consumed without complaint right up to the instantiation line — so a better fake is never the fix. `rules_bazel_integration_test` v0.37.1 is the maintained packaging of the real-subprocess technique, at 25-30 s per test after the fixed-cache-path optimisation (5-7 min without it) and needing an `exclusive` tag because that optimisation shares one on-disk workspace across runs. | `bazel mod deps` exits 0, **and** at least one test target runs a real nested-workspace `bazel` subprocess covering the extension's repository creation. Neither present, in a repository declaring a `module_extension`, is the finding. EMPTY (no module extension) = N/A. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-30 | Split a `module_extension`'s `_impl` into a pure `module_ctx → data` decision function that is unit-tested directly, plus a thin repository-rule-invoking tail that is not. | The invocation tail is unreachable offline on both majors (BZL-TEST-16), so moving the decidable logic out of it is the only way to get any offline coverage of an extension at all. rules_python 2.3.3 is the worked reference — `parse_modules(module_ctx, …) -> mods` is unit-tested against a fake `module_ctx` and the extension keeps only the loop over its output. The counter-example an agent must not pattern-match against is rules_rust's `crate_universe`: tag parsing and repository-rule invocation in one function, zero offline coverage of either half. | Read each `module_extension` `_impl`: it contains at most a loop over the output of a separately-named pure function, and that function appears as the subject of a `unittest.make(` test. An `_impl` that interleaves tag parsing with repository-rule calls is the finding; EMPTY (no module extension) = N/A. | SHOULD |
| BZL-TEST-17 | Name the test package in the `visibility()` allowlist of every private `.bzl` whose `_impl` or helpers need direct unit testing. | `BZL-ARCH-08` requires the load-gate to exist; this row requires it to be wide enough. A leading underscore is a naming convention, not a cross-file boundary, and `visibility()` is the only thing gating `load()` — so a grant that omits the test package silently blocks BZL-TEST-15's technique from reaching the `_impl` at all. | For each private `.bzl` with a tested `_impl`, read its `visibility([...])` list and confirm the test package is in it. A gate that excludes the test package is the finding; a file with no gate at all is `BZL-ARCH-08`'s finding, not this one. EMPTY (every tested `_impl` sits in a file whose gate names the test package) = PASS. | MUST |
| BZL-TEST-18 | Duck-type a hand-rolled ctx fake to exactly the methods the code under test calls; never build a speculative full `repository_ctx`/`module_ctx` reimplementation. | Starlark gives no compile-time contract between a fake struct and the real ctx, and no introspection of a builtin type, so surplus fake surface drifts from reality with nothing to catch it — while a genuinely missing method throws loudly at test time. bazel-skylib 1.9.0 ships no ctx fake of its own, so every ruleset that needs one has reinvented it; rules_python 2.3.3's `tests/support/mocks/mocks.bzl` is the one dogfooded, self-tested reference. | List each fake's struct fields and diff against `grep -n 'ctx\.' <impl-file>` for the functions it stands in for; a fake method with no matching real call site is dead surface to delete. EMPTY diff = PASS. | SHOULD |

```starlark
# wrong — the fail() aborts analysis: no PASS, no FAIL, "No test targets were found"
impl_fail_test = unittest.make(_test_calling_a_failing_impl)
```

```starlark
# right — a throwaway rule() calls the real _impl with the fake ctx
_harness = rule(implementation = _call_impl_with_fake_ctx)   # instantiated with tags = ["manual"]
impl_fail_test = analysistest.make(_assert_message, expect_failure = True)
```

## Coverage

Coverage fails silently at three layers: the test still reports PASS when the report
is empty, `bazel coverage` still exits 0, and the test-encyclopedia never mentions
coverage at all. So the exit code is never the check. Run `bazel coverage //...` once,
then `grep -c '^DA:' bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat`: `0` means nothing was
instrumented (a config bug, and one of four causes below), while `DA:` lines that all
read `,0` mean instrumentation worked and the code never ran (a real coverage gap).
An absent or empty report file beside a green `bazel coverage` is the finding.

| ID | Rule | Rationale | Verification | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BZL-TEST-22 | Set `coverage --instrumentation_filter=^//` (plus `,-^//third_party` or the local vendor path) explicitly in `.bazelrc`, and read the `INFO: Using default value for --instrumentation_filter` line before trusting any coverage number. | The documented static default is `-/javatests[/:],-/test/java[/:]` — two hardcoded Java exclusions and no generic vendor concept — but that value is almost never the operative one: with the flag unset, `bazel coverage` calls `InstrumentationFilterSupport.computeInstrumentationFilter()` and derives a *positive* filter from the packages of the test targets named on the command line. A repository laid out as `//lib/foo` plus `//tests/foo` gets `^//tests/foo[/:]` and instruments none of the library, reporting 0% on exactly the code the test exists to cover. Both code paths are byte-identical at 8.7.0 and 9.2.0. | `grep -n 'coverage --instrumentation_filter' .bazelrc*` — the line must be anchored (`^//`), not the untouched Java-only default. EMPTY in a repository with vendored dependencies is the finding. Then read the `INFO: Using default value for --instrumentation_filter: "..."` line from the run itself: it must cover the library's package, not only the test's. | MUST with vendored deps, SHOULD otherwise |
| BZL-TEST-25 | Gate coverage completeness on the `DA:` records inside the produced `_coverage_report.dat`, never on `bazel coverage`'s exit code and never on the file merely being non-empty. | `WARNING: no coverage report was generated … reporting empty coverage` leaves the test PASSing and the command exiting 0. A merely-non-empty check passes an instrumented-but-never-executed report and an uninstrumented one alike; the lcov `DA:<line>,<count>` record is what separates them, and separating them is what tells a config bug from a genuine gap. | CI step: `grep -c '^DA:' bazel-out/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat` (0 = the finding, nothing instrumented), then `grep '^DA:' <report> \| awk -F, '$2>0' \| wc -l` (0 = a real coverage gap, reported separately from a config bug). | SHOULD |
| BZL-TEST-24 | Pass `--enable_runfiles` on any Windows CI leg that runs `bazel coverage` — and read the pinned ruleset version before reading an absent flag as the finding. | The flag defaults `"auto"`, which is off on Windows only, with a byte-identical option block at 8.7.0 and 9.2.0; a collector that maps coverage back onto sources through runfiles then reports empty coverage while the test still PASSes, leaving only an `ERROR: … code coverage requires a runfiles tree` line. The rule is ruleset-shaped: rules_js 3.4.1 is the confirmed case with exact log text; rules_python ≥1.9.0 forces `--enable_runfiles=true` for `py_binary`/`py_test` on Windows through its own rule-level transition; rules_rust 0.74.0 disclaims Windows support across its whole index. Bazel 9's Windows work did not touch this — the default is unchanged. | `grep -n 'enable_runfiles' .bazelrc* <ci-workflow>` for a repository with a Windows coverage leg, **then** read the pinned ruleset version. EMPTY = the finding on a JS leg; EMPTY = PASS on a rules_python ≥1.9.0 leg unless its config setting turns the flag back off; EMPTY on a Rust leg = measure it (run `bazel coverage` there with `VERBOSE_COVERAGE=1` and read whether paths resolve) rather than assume either way. No Windows coverage leg = N/A. | MUST where a Windows coverage leg exists and the ruleset does not force the flag itself |
| BZL-TEST-26 | Before trusting a Python coverage run, confirm the resolved interpreter has a bundled `coverage` wheel — rules_python 2.3.3 bundles CPython 3.9–3.14 only, and not every platform inside that range. | With `configure_coverage_tool = True` and no matching wheel for the interpreter `bazel coverage` actually selects, rules_python produces no coverage tool at all and the run emits empty lcov data; the only trace is a `py_runtime` analysis-time warning emitted solely while coverage is being collected. The test still passes and the command still exits 0. | Run `bazel coverage` once and read the analysis log for a `py_runtime` coverage-tool warning, then apply the `DA:` count above. A warning, or a zero `DA:` count on a Python target, means the interpreter or platform lacks a bundled wheel — wire `py_runtime.coverage_tool` by hand. EMPTY (no warning **and** a nonzero `DA:` count) = PASS. Re-read the supported range in `docs/coverage.md` at your pinned rules_python tag. | MUST where a Python coverage leg exists |
| BZL-TEST-27 | Pass `--experimental_generate_llvm_lcov` on any coverage leg whose C++ toolchain is clang/LLVM. | The flag defaults `false` at 8.7.0 and 9.2.0 alike. Without it, `collect_cc_coverage.sh` takes its `PROFDATA` branch and writes a raw `.profdata` blob the LCOV merger cannot read — the script's own TODO says so — and that target's C++ coverage vanishes from the combined report. Only the flag switches it to `llvm-cov export -format=lcov`. Both tracking issues named in those TODOs are closed while the TODOs still ship at 9.2.0, so a source comment is not a status signal. | `grep -n 'experimental_generate_llvm_lcov' .bazelrc*` where the C++ toolchain is clang (the tell: `.profraw` files, not `.gcda`, appear in `$COVERAGE_DIR`). EMPTY = the finding under clang; EMPTY with a gcc/gcov toolchain = PASS. | MUST where a clang C++ coverage leg exists |
| BZL-TEST-23 | Pass `--combined_report=lcov` explicitly on any CI leg pinned to Bazel 8, and never write guidance assuming one default across an 8-and-9 matrix. | The default flipped `none` → `lcov` in commit `b6fd304b`, landing in 9.0.0 — read from `BazelCoverageReportModule.java` at the 8.8.0 and 9.2.0 tags, not inferred from prose. A matrix spanning both majors produces a merged report on the 9.x leg and none on the 8.x leg, and the damaging direction is assuming the Bazel 8 leg produces one. | Read the pinned `.bazelversion` and the CI matrix majors, then `grep -n 'combined_report' .bazelrc* <ci-workflow>`. EMPTY with a matrix spanning 8 and 9 is the finding; EMPTY on a 9-only matrix = PASS. | SHOULD |

## Bazel 9's Test Toolchain

Checked by reading the registered execution platforms against the target platforms the
tests build for, and by the toolchain-resolution error itself, which names both
remediations inline. This is the only test-contract change in Bazel 9: the 8.7.0 and
9.1.0 test-encyclopedia snapshots are otherwise byte-identical, and the `test` exec
group with its `test.<key>` `exec_properties` scoping predates 9 (documented at 8.8.0).

| ID | Rule | Rationale | Verification | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BZL-TEST-28 | On Bazel 9, satisfy the implicit `test` exec group's toolchain by registering the test's target platform as an execution platform, or by shipping a custom toolchain for `@bazel_tools//tools/test:default_test_toolchain_type` — never by leaving `--@bazel_tools//tools/test:incompatible_use_default_test_toolchain=false` in place as the fix. | New at 9.0.0 and unchanged through 9.2.0: every test rule carries an implicit `test` exec group with a mandatory toolchain requirement, `build_setting_default = True` from the day it shipped, and [`tools/test/BUILD.tools`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/9.2.0/tools/test/BUILD.tools) carries no such symbol at 8.7.0 or 8.8.0. The escape hatch restores the pre-9 behaviour the toolchain exists to prevent — a test binary built for Linux executing on a Windows machine — and is marked for removal with no date. The separate native `use_target_platform_for_tests` carries its own deprecation warning pointing here and is never the recommendation. | For every target platform a test rule builds against, confirm `register_execution_platforms()` in `MODULE.bazel` (or `bazel config` on the resolved platforms) also registers a compatible execution platform. EMPTY (every target platform has a matching execution platform) = PASS, and the failure is loud: a toolchain-resolution error naming `default_test_toolchain_type`. This is a Starlark `bool_flag`, not a native option — grepping the CLI reference for it returns nothing, and that empty reads "wrong place to look", never "the flag does not exist". | MUST on the escape hatch; SHOULD on the registration |

## Gaps

- Every tag, cache and network result here was measured under `linux-sandbox` on one Linux host and reproduced on no CI runner; `processwrapper-sandbox` (darwin) and `windows-sandbox` are untouched by any of it.
- Windows coverage for `py_test` and `rust_test` is unsettled: rules_python ≥1.9.0 forces the flag at the rule level, rules_rust 0.74.0 disclaims Windows support across its own index, and closing this needs one `bazel coverage` run on a real Windows executor.
- The legacy test-toolchain escape hatch is marked for removal with no version and no tracking issue; the release notes are the only thing to watch.
- `rules_bazel_integration_test` v0.37.1 declares no `bazel_compatibility` field and never has — there is no floor to pin against, so pin the library version and test the Bazel version you run.
- Nothing detects a ctx fake that has drifted off the real API: Starlark cannot introspect a builtin type, so a fake method renamed or removed upstream keeps passing forever (BZL-TEST-18's failure mode, with no check).

## What Agents Get Wrong Here

1. **Recommending `--flaky_test_attempts` to *find* a flaky test** — it is built to make the test pass on the first success, the opposite of detection (BZL-TEST-06).
2. **Diagnosing every empty coverage report as a filter problem** — four causes share the symptom, so count `DA:` lines first and read the `INFO: Using default value for --instrumentation_filter` line the run printed (BZL-TEST-25, BZL-TEST-22, BZL-TEST-24, BZL-TEST-26, BZL-TEST-27).
3. **Wrapping a `repository_rule` or `module_extension` in `analysistest.make()`** — no `Target`, no providers, wrong phase; a throwaway harness rule counts, the repository rule itself never does (BZL-TEST-14).
4. **Reaching for `unittest.make()` to test a `fail()` branch** — it produces no test result at all, and the whole invocation reports "No test targets were found" (BZL-TEST-29).
5. **Assuming a rule's `tags = [...]` reaches every `ctx.actions.run()` it registers** — unconditional for tests and genrules, flag-gated and `putIfAbsent`-shadowed for Starlark actions (BZL-TEST-07).
6. **Treating `no-remote-cache-upload` as `no-remote-cache` with a longer name, or `no-sandbox` as `local` with a longer name** — the second pair differs by whether the action is cacheable at all (BZL-TEST-08).
7. **Assuming `manual` hides a target from `bazel query` or from a CI script walking `query //...`** — it does not, and both official pages say so independently (BZL-TEST-10).
8. **Recommending `--noincompatible_use_default_test_toolchain` to unblock a cross-platform test** — it fixes today's symptom by restoring the silent wrong-OS-execution bug the toolchain exists to prevent (BZL-TEST-28).
