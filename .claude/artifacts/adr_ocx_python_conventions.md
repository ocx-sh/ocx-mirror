# ADR: `ocx_python` upstream-packaging conventions

<!--
Documents the SET of already-implemented, cross-repo conventions the
`ocx_python` pure-translation crate encodes. One coherent decision:
"adopt these deterministic, target-agnostic conventions". The bulk lives in
Technical Details, one subsection per convention. Companion to
adr_ocx_python_crate.md (workspace/boundary decision).

## Context

`ocx_python` (`crates/ocx_python`) is a pure translation library: PEP 751
`pylock.toml` in → OCX package compositions out. It performs no registry I/O and
stays target-agnostic (`lib.rs` "Boundary"). Every rule it applies when turning a
locked Python app into an OCX env package is a **one-way door**: two writers of the
shared registry namespace (`ocx-mirror` today, `ocx-dist` later) must produce
byte-compatible artifacts, or the namespace forks irreversibly.

The crate is implemented. This ADR is the durable reference that pins the
conventions its modules already encode — `lock`, `platform`, `select`, `naming`,
`repack`, `compose`, `collide` (module map in
[subsystem-mirror.md](../rules/subsystem-mirror.md) and the design spec). It
consolidates the design spec's "Conventions" section against the shipped code and
adds the collision convention the spec left implicit.

## Decision Drivers

- **Convention integrity** — one code implementation of each one-way-door rule,
  consumed by all namespace writers; drift corrupts a shared registry.
- **Determinism / content-addressability** — identical inputs must yield the
  identical layer digest, so blobs dedup and re-runs are no-ops.
- **Target-agnosticism** — the crate must not embed a registry host; the host is
  a single, explicit consumer seam.
- **Fail-closed safety** — malformed lock content, ABI drift, path overlap, and
  zip-bombs abort before anything is pushed, not at the user's runtime.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Deterministic, target-agnostic conventions encoded once (chosen)

Every rule frozen in code, grammar-versioned where it can evolve
(`REPACK_VERSION`, `L2_GRAMMAR_VERSION`), emitting repo-relative identifiers and
the two registry-independent thirds of an `Info` (`Metadata` + `Platform`).

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| One source of truth for cross-repo artifacts | Convention changes are republish events |
| Byte-identical, content-addressed layers | Grammar-version bookkeeping needed |
| Host injected at exactly one seam | Crate cannot short-circuit registry checks |

### Option 2: Host-coupled composition (rejected)

Let the crate assemble a full `Info` with the registry `Identifier` baked in.
Rejected: couples the translation logic to the mirror's registry, blocks the
ocx-dist reuse that motivates the crate, and defeats content-addressing.

### Option 3: Per-writer ad-hoc conventions (rejected)

Each consumer implements naming/repack/layout itself. Rejected: guarantees drift
in the one place drift is unrecoverable — the shared namespace.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 1. The crate encodes the seven conventions below.
Each is grounded in the module/constant/function that implements it; the crate's
public error types map to consumer exit codes (`error.rs`, and
[subsystem-mirror.md](../rules/subsystem-mirror.md) "Error Model").

## Technical Details

### Convention 1 — Naming (PEP 503 normalization + conventional repo path)

`naming::wheel_reference(scope, wheel)` renders the repo-relative, host-free
reference `<scope>/<index-host>/<package>/<slug>:<sha256>`:

- **Package segment** — `naming::normalize_package_name` (`naming.rs`): lowercase,
  and collapse runs of `-` / `_` / `.` to a single `-` (equivalent to
  `re.sub(r"[-_.]+", "-", name).lower()`). `Flask_Cors` → `flask-cors`,
  `A.B_C-D` → `a-b-c-d`.
- **Scope** — `WheelScope`, defaulting to `DEFAULT_WHEEL_SCOPE = "pip-packages"`;
  maintainer-configurable.
- **Index-host** — the URL authority via a hand-rolled `extract_host` (no `url`
  dep in this crate); folds `.`/`..` to the `unknown-index-host` fallback as a
  CWE-22 path-traversal guard.
- **Slug** — `wheel_slug`: the wheel's build tag (if any) plus its **ABI and
  platform tags**, deliberately **not** the Python tag — the slug disambiguates
  build/variant, not interpreter.
- **Tag** — the wheel's `sha256` (hex, no `sha256:` prefix): content-addressed.

The reference carries **no registry host**; the consumer prepends the registry
when it builds the final `ocx_lib::oci::Identifier`.

**Mirror-side mirror of the normalizer.** The app-name match in the mirror's
`source/pylock.rs` (`normalize_package_name`, used by `app_version`) is a
byte-identical **copy** of `ocx_python`'s private normalizer. `naming`'s function
is not part of the crate's public API; duplicating the ~12 lines is the deliberate
choice over widening the crate surface for one caller (documented in-line there).

### Convention 2 — Repack determinism

`repack::repack_wheel` writes one deterministic `tar.zst` layer per wheel, stamped
by `REPACK_VERSION = "repack-v1"`. Determinism knobs (`write_deterministic_tar_zst`):

- entries **sorted by path** (`tree.sort_by` before write);
- **epoch-0 mtimes** (`set_mtime(0)`), **uid/gid 0**;
- **normalized modes** — `MODE_FILE = 0o644`, `MODE_EXECUTABLE = 0o755` (the latter
  only for `.data/scripts` launchers);
- **pinned `ZSTD_LEVEL = 3`** (matches `ocx_lib::compression::CompressionLevel::Default`).

The layer digest is the sha256 of these bytes. The golden test
`golden_digest_is_stable_across_runs` pins the byte-identical output for the
`purelib_pkg` fixture to
`sha256:330a642c4e7fcc3a565889e85091f8397780a78ad360601c81fbe9e371cd8ebe` — any
drift is a determinism regression.

**Security guards** (both fail before an unbounded operation):

- **Zip-bomb** — `MAX_TOTAL_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES = 1 << 30` (1 GiB) across all
  entries, enforced by reading capped (`read_entry_capped` reads one byte over the
  remaining budget and aborts) → `RepackError::WheelTooLarge` (CWE-409). The
  budget is never near a real wheel; it exists only to abort a malicious/corrupt
  zip.
- **Zip-slip** — entry paths via `enclosed_name`, RECORD paths via
  `record_components`; an absolute path or `..` traversal is
  `RepackError::UnsafeEntryPath`.

`RepackError` maps to exit **1** (`ExecutionFailed`) — an I/O/zip fault, not
malformed data.

### Convention 3 — Layout (`.data` relocation → single content-root layer)

`repack::relocate` emits the **final relocated tree** so the layer needs no
placement metadata:

| Wheel-relative source | Relocated destination | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `<dist>.data/scripts/*` | `bin/*` | `0755` (executable) |
| `<dist>.data/data/*` | content root (verbatim subpath; conventionally `share/…`) | `0644` |
| purelib / platlib / `<dist>.dist-info/*` | `lib/site-packages/*` | `0644` |
| `<dist>.data/{purelib,platlib,headers}/*` | `lib/site-packages/*` (fallback) | `0644` |

Because one wheel spans **three** destination prefixes (`lib/site-packages/`,
`bin/`, `share/…`) that a single layer prefix cannot express, each wheel becomes
**one content-addressed layer applied at the content root with an EMPTY
`LayerLayoutSpec`** (`compose::WheelLayer.layout` defaults empty; the field exists
only because `ocx_lib`'s layer-ref requires a spec, not to relocate wheels). The
tar already carries the final paths.

Env metadata baked by `compose` (`EnvBuilder`): `PYTHONPATH =
${installPath}/lib/site-packages` (**required**), `PATH = ${installPath}/bin`
(**optional** — a pure-python app whose only entrypoints are synthesized console
scripts ships no `bin/`), and `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE = 1` (keeps CPython from
writing `__pycache__/` into read-only package content).

### Convention 4 — Entrypoint synthesis

`compose_env` synthesizes one entrypoint per **gated** `[console_scripts]` entry,
each `{ command: "python3", args: ["-c", <shim>] }` (argv array, no shell). The
shim (`synthesize_shim`) is:

```python
import importlib, sys
sys.argv[0] = "<name>"
_obj = importlib.import_module("<module>")
_obj = getattr(_obj, "<attr>")   # repeated per attr in the dotted chain
sys.exit(_obj())
```

- Resolution is `importlib.import_module` + a `getattr`-walk over the attr chain —
  **never** a `from … import …` template, which cannot express a dotted attribute
  reference (`pkg.mod:Class.method`).
- **`sys.argv[0] = "<name>"`** so click/argparse report the real program name.
  Regression fixed: without it a process saw `argv[0] == "-c"` and printed
  `-c, …` in `--version`/`--help`. The name is validated as an `EntrypointName`
  (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`) before it is embedded, so no escaping is needed.
- A malformed reference (empty module/attr, more than one `:`) is
  `ComposeError::InvalidEntryPoint`.

**A bare `python3` entrypoint (`{ command: "python3", args: [] }`) is ALWAYS
synthesized** (`entries.entry(python3).or_insert_with(…)`). A LIBRARY env with no
console script (e.g. `google-cloud-aiplatform`) is otherwise unrunnable; a plain
`ocx run <env> -- python3 …` override does **not** get the package's private env
(PYTHONPATH), so imports fail. Dispatching `python3` as an entrypoint runs the
composed interpreter **with** the env applied — the only way to `import` the
library. Insertion is skipped if a wheel already shipped a `python3` console
script (never observed; fail-safe).

**Extras gating.** A script is synthesized only when **every** extra it is gated on
is in `EnvSpec.requested_extras`
(`script.extras.iter().all(|e| requested_extras.contains(e))`); the empty gate is
always synthesized. So `blackd = blackd:main [d]` is **not** synthesized for plain
`black` (extra `d` unrequested). Requested extras are validated against the lock's
declared `extras` (`EnvSpec.declared_extras`); an unknown extra is
`ComposeError::UnknownExtra` — a typo fails closed rather than registering an
unresolvable launcher. Gating is never inferred from dependency presence.

### Convention 5 — Platform / axis encoding

A Python target is 5-axis `(os, arch, libc{family,floor}, python, abi)`; an OCX
`Platform` carries os/arch only. `platform.rs` layers the mapping:

- **L1** (`parse_platform_tag`) — a PEP 425/600/656 wheel tag → `PlatformFacts`;
  frozen fact table (e.g. `manylinux_2_28_x86_64` → `{Linux, Amd64, gnu≥2.28}`).
- **L2** (`encode_l2`, grammar `L2_GRAMMAR_VERSION = 1`) — os/arch →
  `ocx_lib::oci::Platform` (`encode_platform_key`); libc/ABI → a mirror **variant
  tag prefix** (`encode_variant_prefix`): default (glibc + primary ABI) → `None`
  (unadorned), `musl` libc → `"musl"`, ABI override → e.g. `"cp313t"`, both →
  `"musl-cp313t"`. v1→v2 (the planned `+libc` platform grammar) is a republish; L1
  facts are stable across both.

The **variant axis** (`VariantConstraints`) is bounded to L1 fact fields — libc
family, `min_manylinux` / `min_musllinux` floors, and an ABI override — never a
free-form tag regex. `encode_variant_prefix` rejects internally inconsistent
variants (`musl` libc with a `manylinux` floor, or a `musllinux` floor without a
`musl` libc) as `PlatformError::InvalidVariant`.

**ABI consistency at compose (fail closed).** `compose::check_abi` requires every
wheel's ABI to be universal (`none`, `abi3`) or exactly the target's
**effective ABI** — `PythonTarget::effective_abi()` = the variant override else the
interpreter pin. A concrete `cpXY(t)` that differs (e.g. a `cp313` wheel against a
free-threaded `cp313t` interpreter), or an unparseable wheel filename, is
`ComposeError::AbiMismatch` (exit 65). `select` applies the same invariant earlier
via `validate_abi_consistency` (`SelectError::AbiMismatch`, comparing the
`gil_disabled` flag), so drift is caught at both selection and composition.

### Convention 6 — Marker-env / wheel selection

`select::select_wheels(lock, target)` picks exactly one wheel per applicable
package for one `(variant, platform key)` target:

1. **Marker environment** — `platform::marker_environment(facts, interpreter)`
   builds the versioned `MarkerEnvironment`; `select` converts it into a
   `uv_pep508::MarkerEnvironment` (`build_marker_environment`).
2. **Package filter** — evaluate each package's PEP 508 marker
   (`package_applies`); non-applicable packages (OS forks, implementation forks)
   are **dropped**, not failed. A malformed marker is `SelectError::MarkerSyntax`.
3. **Target tag set** — `Tags::from_env` from `uv-platform-tags` (python/abi +
   libc-floored platform), so `abi3` spanning minors, `py2.py3-none-any`, and
   `any` fall out of **tag-compatibility semantics, never string equality**.
4. **Rank** — `pick_wheel` keeps `TagCompatibility::Compatible(priority)`
   candidates, best by (tag priority, PEP 427 build tag, filename) — the last two
   deterministic tiebreaks.
5. Zero compatible wheels for an applicable package →
   `SelectError::NoCompatibleWheel` naming package, target, variant, and the tags
   that **were** available (distinguishing psycopg2-style "no wheel for this
   triple" from uwsgi-style "no wheel anywhere") → **exit 65**. A selected wheel
   with no URL is `SelectError::MissingUrl` (not mirrorable).

**Marker-env table** — the values `marker_environment` derives for the reference
target **CPython 3.14.6 / cp314 on linux-amd64**:

| Marker variable | Value | Source in `platform.rs` |
|---|---|---|
| `python_version` | `3.14` | `interpreter.python_version` |
| `python_full_version` | `3.14.6` | `interpreter.python_full_version` |
| `sys_platform` | `linux` | OS-axis map (Linux) |
| `platform_system` | `Linux` | OS-axis map (Linux) |
| `os_name` | `posix` | OS-axis map (Unix-like) |
| `platform_machine` | `x86_64` | `platform_machine(Linux, Amd64)` |
| `implementation_name` | `cpython` | `Implementation::CPython` |
| `platform_python_implementation` | `CPython` | `Implementation::CPython` |

(`platform_machine` is OS-dependent: Linux/macOS report `x86_64`/`aarch64`/`arm64`,
Windows reports `AMD64`/`ARM64`. `select` additionally passes
`implementation_version = python_full_version` and leaves `platform_release` /
`platform_version` empty.)

### Convention 7 — Collision / overlap-free union

OCX's prefix-layer union is **overlap-free by design**, so a valid resolved lock
composes a correct `site-packages` by construction. `collide::check_collisions` is
the pre-publish guard proving the invariant for a concrete wheel set: two repacked
wheels claiming the same installed (post-relocation) path is
`CollisionError::OverlappingPaths` naming the path and both wheels → **exit 65**,
failing before push rather than corrupting the registry.

**PEP 420 namespace dirs are shared safely.** A wheel's `RECORD` lists only files,
never bare directories, so two dists contributing distinct leaves under the same
namespace directory (`google/cloud/foo/__init__.py` vs
`google/cloud/bar/__init__.py`) never produce equal path strings and never collide.

**Coexisting-hostile-distribution caveat.** Some `[extras]` closures pull
mutually-exclusive dists that ship a **byte-identical same-path** file — observed:
`mlflow` / `mlflow-skinny` / `mlflow-tracing` all ship an identical
`mlflow/__init__.py`. OCX's overlap-free model rejects this rather than tolerating
overlap (even byte-identical overlap). The resolution is **lock curation** — exclude
the redundant subset with `uv … --no-emit-package` and keep the superset — i.e.
respecting OCX's model, not fighting it with a merge/dedupe special case.

### Convention 8 — libc-variant interpreter provisioning & container validation

Convention 5 encodes libc as a **variant** (a tag prefix), never an `os/arch`
platform key. Its mirror-side realization pins two one-way-door registry
conventions:

**Interpreter provisioning.** An env's private interpreter dependency is resolved
**per variant**. The default (glibc) variant uses `python.interpreter_package`
(the stock `ocx.sh/cpython:<ver>` — a glibc/manylinux CPython). A `libc: musl`
variant overrides it with a per-variant `interpreter_package` pointing at a
**musl-libc CPython published to a *separate repository*** —
`dev.ocx.sh/ocx/cpython-musl:<ver>` — not a musl candidate inside the glibc
`cpython` index. This is forced by OCX's platform model: index candidates are
keyed by `os/arch` only, so a musl and a glibc `linux/amd64` cannot coexist under
one tag; libc is the variant axis, so the two libc builds are two repos. The musl
interpreter is a plain single-layer archive package (`install_only` tarball,
`strip=1`, `PATH=${installPath}/bin`) — the same shape as the glibc one, no
entrypoints. `VariantSpec.interpreter_package` (mirror spec) is the seam;
`Source::Pylock.package` lets a `pycowsay-musl` mirror resolve the `pycowsay`
package from a shared lock without a name collision.

**Container validation.** A libc-variant env is validated in a libc-matched base
image: the `alpine` leg exercises the `musl` variant end-to-end, the `debian` leg
sanity-checks the glibc floor (an older glibc than the CI runner). The generated
workflow keeps the job on the host runner (JS actions need the glibc node GitHub
mounts, which Alpine's musl userland cannot run) and wraps only `ocx package test`
in `docker run <image>` with a statically-linked, **libc-matched ocx release
binary** mounted in (musl for `alpine*`, gnu otherwise). The runner CA bundle is
mounted at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` because the gnu ocx verifies TLS
against the system store, which a minimal image omits (the musl ocx bundles webpki
roots). The env under test is self-contained (local wheel layers); only its
private interpreter is pulled — anonymously — from the registry.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- **Deterministic** — pinned repack knobs + the golden digest test make the same
  wheel produce the same layer bytes on every run and every writer.
- **Content-addressable** — wheels are named by `sha256`; identical blobs dedup,
  re-runs are no-ops.
- **Target-agnostic** — the crate emits `Metadata` + `Platform` (the two
  registry-independent thirds of an `Info`) and repo-relative identifiers; it never
  constructs a registry-bearing `Identifier`. `EnvComposition::into_info(identifier)`
  is the **sole seam** where the consumer injects the registry host, so the same
  translation logic serves `ocx-mirror` and `ocx-dist` unchanged.
- **Fail-closed** — malformed locks, ABI drift, path overlap, and zip-bombs abort
  before push (exit 65 for data faults, 1 for I/O), never at the user's runtime.

**Negative:**

- Any convention change (repack layout, L2 grammar) is a **republish** event, not
  an in-place edit — hence the `REPACK_VERSION` / `L2_GRAMMAR_VERSION` stamps.
- The mirror-side normalizer is duplicated (Convention 1); a PEP 503 change must be
  applied in two places until the normalizer is promoted to the crate's public API.

**Risks:**

- Convention drift between writers corrupts the shared namespace irreversibly.
  Mitigation: this ADR + the golden/marker-env/encode tests are the guard; the L1
  fact table and L2 encoding are frozen and versioned in code.

## Validation

- [x] Unit tests cover each convention: `golden_digest_is_stable_across_runs`
  (repack), `parse_*` / `encode_l2_*` / `marker_env_*` (platform), `select_*`
  (select), `*_collision*` (collide), shim/extras/ABI tests (compose),
  `normalizes_package_names_per_pep_503` (naming).
- [x] Security guards tested: `zip_slip_entry_is_rejected`,
  `zip_bomb_decompressed_size_is_capped`.
- [ ] Acceptance corpus (design spec "Testing strategy") exercises the conventions
  end-to-end per platform leg.
