"""Generate a clickable review page that sorts a diff by what actually moves a contract.

Ported from ocx (.claude/scripts/review_surface.py); only the tier map — which
paths carry wire, CLI and test code — is adapted to the mirror's layout.

Motivation, measured on ocx#227: 9241 lines changed, of which 384 (4.2%) were
production logic. 2816 of the 4069 added Rust lines lived inside `#[cfg(test)]`
regions *of production files*, so any file-level view — GitHub's included —
structurally cannot show which files carry real changes.

Tiers are therefore assigned PER LINE:

    T0 WIRE   mirror.yml spec / lock parsing / generated workflows — breaks other programs
    T1 CLI    flags, `--format json` shapes, exit codes — what callers branch on
    T2 API    new public types and changed signatures
    T3 LOGIC  no contract signal; read anyway
    T4 DOC / T5 TEST / T6 SCAFFOLD  — counted, not ranked

T3 is enumerated by file and never collapsed to a count. It carries no syntactic
contract signal, which is exactly why hiding it would steer a reviewer away from
the largest change in a PR while looking authoritative. On ocx#227 the single
biggest production file (oci/index/local_index.rs, 47 lines) is a T3.

Dependencies are declared inline (PEP 723) and resolved by `uv run --script`, so
there is no venv to create and nothing to add to a pyproject. `uvx` is
`uv tool run` — it runs PyPI tools, not local scripts, and refuses this path.

Usage:
    task claude:review-surface -- 227                        # a PR
    uv run --script .claude/scripts/review_surface.py 227
    uv run --script .claude/scripts/review_surface.py --base main
    uv run --script .claude/scripts/review_surface.py 227 --no-open

Output: out/review-<slug>.html (gitignored), self-contained, opened in the
default browser. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
