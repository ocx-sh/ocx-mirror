"""Write the CI-only Bazel cache rc file and the credential helper it names.

Run by `.github/actions/bazel-cache-rc`, never by hand. **Two credentials, and
they are not symmetric.** The read credential is a plain `--remote_header` line
— a value Bazel sends, never one it runs. The write credential cannot be,
because of BZL-CACHE-04 below, and reaches Bazel through a helper program
instead.

* **BZL-CACHE-04** — Bazel resolves and spawns a `--credential_helper` with the
  full client environment, before the sandbox, with no check on where the flag
  came from, so a read-only `bazel query //...` on a fresh clone is enough to
  execute it (bazel#30439, closed by the vendor as intended). The helper
  therefore lives under `$RUNNER_TEMP`, named by an rc file that never ships
  with the repository and is never `%workspace%`-relative.
* **BZL-CACHE-01** — every lane an untrusted contributor can trigger runs the
  cache read-only with the write credential *absent*, not merely unused. An
  empty `WRITE_AUTH` is that state, and it emits no `--credential_helper` line
  at all, which is a stronger statement than an rc file holding an empty
  credential. With *both* variables empty — the fork-PR lane, which GitHub
  gives no secrets — no rc file is written at all, and the lane reads the cache
  anonymously over `--disk_cache`. That is the documented fallback, not a
  failure: a step that fails loudly on a fork is the defect.
* **DX-81, one credential source per lane** — Bazel `add`s an `Authorization`
  header per configured source rather than replacing it, and sends all of them:
  measured against a local sink with both routes live, one cache `PUT` carried
  three. Which one an origin honours is that origin's business, and a design
  that needs to know is the defect. So a lane presents exactly one credential,
  and `main()` below refuses rather than write a second — both variables set at
  once, or a credential already configured in an rc file Bazel will read.

The credential arrives in the environment and is never passed as an argument:
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is readable by any process of that user, and `set -x`
traces expanded arguments.
