# Red/green proof for `.github/actions/bazel-cache-rc`.
#
# Run it directly: `bash .github/actions/bazel-cache-rc/selftest.sh`. It touches
# no network and no real credential — the shared cache realm is deliberately not
# reachable from a check (plan C-029), so every property below is established
# against a scratch `$RUNNER_TEMP` and a fake credential this script invents.
#
# Seven properties, each shown **both** red and green, because a green whose red
# was never reachable is indistinguishable from a check that never ran
# (quality-core.md § Unchecked Green):
#
#   1. a non-empty write credential writes the rc and the helper, owner-only
#   2. an empty credential writes nothing at all
#   3. the cleanup step removes both, and is green when there was nothing to
#      remove — the state a job that failed before the write leaves behind
#   4. the credential reaches no command line, so `set -x` cannot log it
#   5. nothing already at those paths is ever written through
#   6. the read credential is a quoted `--remote_header` and no helper at all
#   7. a second credential source is refused, and the refusal is not the leak
#
# The step bodies are read out of `action.yml` with a YAML parser rather than
# copied here, so this script cannot drift into proving something the action no
# longer does. Every mutation is checked to have landed before its red is
# believed: the harness is not exempt.
